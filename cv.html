				  <br/>
				<p>I've been a professional software developer since 
					2009. My career has been mostly focused as a backend developer but I do it all: </p>

					  <ul>
						<li>Backend</li>
					  	<li>Frontend</li>
					  	<li>Bash scripting</li>
					  	<li>Pair programming</li>
					  	<li>Agile development methodologies</li>
					  	<li>Continuous integration</li>
					  	<li>Chat ops</li>
					  	<li>Issue tracking </li>
					  	<li>Systems integration testing</li>
					  	<li>User acceptance testing </li>
					  	<li>Webpage optimization</li>
					  	<li>Business strategy</li>
				  	 </ul>
					 <p> In 2009, I got a computer science degree from the University of Virginia School of Engineering. My thesis project was on local foodshed mapping - I used Google Maps overlays in KML to visualize how food moves from the producer to the consumer. Did you know that in the U.S., the average carrot travels 1800 miles from the farm to your dinner plate?</p>

					  <p>I built my first website in high school - it was devoted to probabilities in poker. I was very popular with the ladies. </p>

					  <p>Here’s what I’ve been up to lately: </p>

					  <h2>Zappling, A Division of 2RW</h2>

					  <p>2RW is a sustainable energy consulting company that works on LEED-certification and comprehensive green energy solutions. In English: we help buildings, campuses, and governments save money and tread lightly on the planet through efficient energy usage. Zappling is 2RW’s software division, and I’m the co-head of web development there. </p>
					  <p>I write software that tracks, monitors, and analyzes a compendium of data from affordable housing properties to make detailed engineering calculations related to energy use.  </p>

					  <p>I’ve also developed API architecture that connects several related web apps through a common interface to reuse building information, streamline client web services, implement internal single sign-ons, and handle user roles across all apps. </p>

					  <p>A day in the life at Zappling for me includes issue tracking via GitHub Issues, training teammates to adopt new workflows, troubleshooting IT problems across all departments, testing, scheduling DB backups, and data syncing between environments. Frequently, I can also be found implementing Heroku CI/CD for Rails apps to augment workflows and ensure new code has adequate test coverage. </p>

					  <h2>Commonwealth Joe</h2>

					  <p>In 2012, I co-founded a coffee roast retailer, Commonwealth Joe. In addition to the wearing-all-hats that happens in an early-stage startup, I served as the CTO. I oversaw the improvement and evolution of all technical parts of the business, including e-commerce integration with Shopify. I also envisioned and developed our entire cold brew line, which is now the fastest-growing part of CJoe.</p> 

					  <p>Commonwealth Joe has been a huge success. We currently have two flagship stores, a roastery, and a brewery that provides nitro cold brew to offices up and down the east coast. To date we have raised over $2 million in venture funding. While my co-founder Robbie now runs the business full-time as CEO, I have stepped away but continue to serve in an advisory role. </p>

					  <h2>Other Professional Work</h2>

					  <p>The above describes my day job for the past seven years. Prior to that, I worked as an application services consultant at IBM. I oversaw code deployment and database updates for a $1 billion Department of Homeland Security project. I conducted System Integration Testing (SIT) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for development releases, and supported and trained the team in technical change management. I also developed metrics and analysis for team-wide financial data collection. </p>
